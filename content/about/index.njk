  <h2>My Professional Career</h2>
  <p>I started my software engineer career in Cognizant, India, in November 2009. During my two years and four months of tenure here, I was part of a research & development team and built tools and frameworks that aid automation testing. The tech stack is predominantly from the DotNet ecosystem, and C# is the primary language. </p>
  <p>In my quest to learn SAAS, I joined ABCO Advisory Services, India, a leading health services product company. In my four years and six months there, I built and maintained an analytical platform designed to help health organizations monitor practice performance across different segments. I was involved in the end-to-end lifecycle of this SAAS product.</p>
  <p>After working with DotNet technologies for nearly seven years, I have decided to move out of my comfort zone and work with other languages and their ecosystems.</p>
  <p>For the next five years and eight months, I worked with Ajira, a premium software services and consulting firm in Chennai, India. As a principal software engineer, I collaborate with enterprises, startups, and entrepreneurs and engineer their ideas into excellent products. I take care of end-to-end ownership from inception to production deployment and maintenance.</p>
  <p>In a typical project at Ajira, I work with the client to understand their requirements, then collaborate with them on prioritizing the deliverables and engineering the products iteratively. During my tenure there, I participated in eleven projects (typically three to six months). I have shipped products using Golang, Kotlin, F#, Clojure, Haskell, Elm, Scala, Python, Javascript, and Java.</p>
  <p>In November 2021,  Chargebee acquired Ajira, and I joined as a Technical Architect. </p>
  <p>During this stint, I helped revamp their entire release process. By streamlining their <a href="https://github.com/chargebee/distributed-gitflow" class="underline" target="_blank">branching strategy</a> and building tools to automate certain manual activities, I reduced the manual efforts in the release process to two hours from 14 hours. </p>
  <p>Outside of this, I developed the foundation for the end-to-end test automation test cases. I have reviewed and advised various organizational initiatives as part of the governance team. </p>
  <p>Then, I led Chargebeeâ€™s API Infrastructure revamp initiative. As part of this, I built a tool to create <a href="https://github.com/chargebee/openapi" class="underline" target="_blank">Open API specifications</a> for the Chargebee APIs and set up the foundation for building SDKs from this spec. As a wrap-up, I led the team in building the API docs from this specification. </p>
  <p>During this time, I was also responsible for researching and defining the direction for Chargebeeâ€™s Usage Based Billing capability. </p>
  <p>Currently as a Senior Technical Architect, I am architecting and leading the team in a re-platforming work to enable Chargebee to provide an Omni-channel subscription management across multiple marketplaces like Apple App Store, Google Play Store, etc. </p>
  <h2>My Side Projects Career</h2>
  <p>Programming has been my favorite pastime activity ever since I saw the computer. I always build something to satisfy my intellectual curiosity using what I have learned or am learning.</p>
  <p>It all started with building a website using HTML and CSS at fifteen. During my college days (2005-2007), I developed a blood donor directory application using C++ to exercise my OO skills. I made a distributed file search tool using Java Aglets for my final year project.</p>
  <p>My Open-Source Journey started in March 2012 with <a href="https://github.com/OdeToCode/p5/pull/1" class="underline" target="_blank"> a pull request</a> to a tiny HTML-JS presentation library. Then, I open-sourced [Jade-Visualizer](https://github.com/tamizhvendan/jade-visualizer), an application I built while learning Node.Js. I fell in love with functional programming when using it in C#, leading me to understand Haskell. After dabbling with Haskell for some time, I wanted to put my learning into action and end up in F#. </p>
  <p>I was one of the early adopters of F# in India. Based on the experiences I gained while working on a couple of F# projects, I self-published two books, <a href="https://www.demystifyfp.com/FsApplied/" class="underline" target="_blank"> F# Applied</a> and <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="https://www.demystifyfp.com/FsApplied2/">F# Applied II</a>; both are practical guides on developing web applications in F# using FP principles. I also authored a couple of open-source F# libraries, <a href="https://www.demystifyfp.com/FsConfig/"  class="underline" target="_blank">FsConfig</a> and <a href="https://demystifyfp.gitbook.io/fstoolkit-errorhandling/" class="underline" target="_blank">FsToolkit.ErrorHandling</a>. </p>
  <p>I have been actively working on an open-source product, <a href="https://github.com/graphqlize/honeyeql"  class="underline" target="_blank">HoneyEQL, for the past four years</a>. It is a Clojure library that enables querying from relational databases (Postgres and MySQL) using EDN Query Language. </p>
  <p>I have also been <a href="https://www.tamizhvendan.in/"  class="underline" target="_blank">blogging</a> since 2011. I have also spoken at various user group meetups and conferences, such as Functional Conf, SkillsMatter&#39;s F# Exchange, and F# Conference. My talks on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GneIxgl71NM&amp;list=PL7KfI5BN1rLJ47AaVcPfI79lcpKoAAF3Q&amp;index=2"  class="underline" target="_blank">Rethinking State Management</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj0Z0MJlfD4&amp;list=PL7KfI5BN1rLJ47AaVcPfI79lcpKoAAF3Q&amp;index=3"  class="underline" target="_blank">Building an e-commerce middleware in Clojure</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxmdVstSndE&amp;list=PL7KfI5BN1rLJ47AaVcPfI79lcpKoAAF3Q&amp;index=4"  class="underline" target="_blank">Concurrent Programming in F#</a> were received well. I also authored a <a href="https://fsharp.tv/courses/build-a-suave_based_web-server/"  class="underline" target="_blank">video course on Fsharp.TV</a>.</p>
  <p>I run my e-learning website, <a href="https://www.learncsintamil.com"  class="underline" target="_blank">Learn CS in Tamil</a>, which empowers people to create a fulfilling and sustainable career in the IT industry through courses, sessions, and podcasts in my regional language(Tamil).</p>
  <p>Last but not least, I run my own SAAS product, <a href="https://www.kalvify.com"  class="underline" target="_blank">Kalvify</a> (Shopify for e-learning). As a solopreneur, I take care of everything from development to sales. </p>
