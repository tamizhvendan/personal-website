In the pursuit of becoming a better programmer, I have come across lot of good things, which in fact have a lot of positive impact on my thinking, attitude and the way I approach a problem.  One of such thing is the book [Passionate Programmer](http://pragprog.com/book/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer) which I am currently reading. It is all about creating a remarkable career in software development. If you are a developer, it is a highly recommended book.     

There are a lot of impressive tips we can learn from this book of wisdom. One of Such tip is “Practice, Practice, and Practice!!” It talks about how to practice as a software developer. Though it seems like a mighty task, the author “Chad Fowler” convey this by breaking the might task into the following three category (Divide and Conquer Approach).

### Physical/Coordination
* Learn and master the unexplored areas of the language that you are working with. Say for example, Regular Expressions
* Dig your language’s API and don’t reinvent the wheel
  
### Sight Reading
* Learn by reading the code
* Pick any of your favorite open source, explore it understand and learn the tips and tricks of the trade
* Add some new feature
* Be sure to vary the software you work with

### Improvisation
* Takes some structure or constraint and creating something new, on the fly on top of that structure. For example pick a simple program and try to write it with the self-imposed constraints
* Play with Code Katas

## It’s time for action

I believe these three very fundamental aspects makes a lot of difference. So, I’ve decided to get my hands dirty with these three things and here is my list of to dos.

**Physical/Coordination** – (I pick C# as its my primary language in my current role)
* Regular Expressions
* Dynamic Programming
* Multithreading
* Parallel Programming
* LINQ
* Reflection
* Streams and Networking
* Entity Framework
* Data Structures and Algorithms
* Customizing MVC3 Framework

**Sight Reading**
* Exploring ASP.NET MVC3 source code
* Exploring Nunit source Code
* Blog my understanding during this exploration

**Improvisation**
* Make most of Code Katas
* Active participation in Technical Forums
